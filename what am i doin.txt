1: program finds num of args and creates malloc array to fit them all

1.1: program sends args to be convert.c

1.2: convert.c sends each arg to be converted to string, then adds to array of strings

2: program receives string array, 
loops through printf-string
when encountering '%', check i+1
if supported letter found, send string array index to putstr, returning num of chars printed

how do I always make 'just enough'?
