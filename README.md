  About me:
Originally from the United States, California. Moved to Paris in 2015, graduated highschool, left to the Netherlands in 2021 during Covid Lockdowns
to begin a degree in Electrical Engineering. About 6 months in, I decided to drop out for about 10 different reasons. While I was figuring things out,
I decided to begin dog-sitting as a side gig. It quickly became my full time job and paid all the bills for the next 2 years. While this was the best
time of my life, caring for dogs, being with nature, cooking new dishes, I found my creative side aching again. I wanted to get back into tech one way
or another. 

I applied to the 42 introduction course while I was in the Netherlands, just for fun to see what would happen. To my surprise, I was accepted, with only
two weeks to prepare. Only two weeks to get back to Paris to take the Piscine and find a place to live for that month. I ended up finding a few
friends who were willing to let me stay on their couch for a few days each. So I was bouncing between houses every few days while still making it to
class at 8am every day to study the Piscine projects. I'm poor and could not afford this trip at all, so during the whole Piscine I was just
eating raw vegetables and fruits I found at the store on the way to class each day. I learned you can eat the skin of Kiwis and it's actually delicious.

After the final Exam. I took my train back to the Netherlands and waited....Impatiently. 

I was accepted, realiezd I needed to FULLY MOVE back to Paris within one week. So I closed my dog-sitting busines, said goodbye to all my friends (and dogs)
and found a cheap shared apartment in the north of Paris. Still, I needed to find a way to pay rent while living here, I've currently found a few odd-jobs
that are paying the bills and letting me study. I'm going slower than average because of this, but still progressing.
